# Hepatic Cancer Prediction Using Python

A Smart Web-Application for Risk Assessment of Pancreatic Cancer by analysing an individual's retrospective data

## Background
 With just 5% survival rates, Pancreatic Cancer continues to be one of the most lethal cancers in the world. It takes away the lives of around 300,000 people worldwide. The only way to increase the survival rates of this cancer is to screen it in its early stages.

This Algorithm predicts the Associative Risk involved for Pancreatic Cancer incidence in an individual. It analyses a patient’s retrospective data including his *age, sex*, etc. and infers from the dataset collected from **‘Cancer Today’** as well as relative risk increase from **National Center for Biotechnology Information** to predict the final cumulative risk of developing pancreatic cancer. The vanilla version of this algorithm was developed in Jupyter Notebook using **Pandas**.

## Libraries & Pre-Requisites
- Anaconda - Python 3.6.5
- Pandas (Python Library)

## Dataset
The dataset for Pancreatic Cancer incidence distribution can be obtained [here](http://gco.iarc.fr/today/online-analysis-table?v=2018&mode=population&mode_population=countries&population=900&populations=900&key=asr&sex=0&cancer=13&type=0&statistic=5&prevalence=0&population_group=0&ages_group%5B%5D=0&ages_group%5B%5D=17&nb_items=5&group_cancer=1&include_nmsc=1&include_nmsc_other=1)
